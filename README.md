 This project aims at prototyping some realtime apps based on node.js
 
 example.
 
 Realtime dashboards.
 as a start, the project includes a graph that is rendered with data being pushed across from server peridically.
 
 high charts is used a s charting module
 socket.io library is used for server side push.
 express.js is also used to serve out the client html files thru static directories.
